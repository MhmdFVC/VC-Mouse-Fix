Based off of [Lighnat0r's mouse sensitivity reset script](https://github.com/Lighnat0r-pers/Files/blob/master/GTA%20VC%20No%20Mouse%20Sensitivity%20Reset.zip), but modified to be specifically for VC and includes y-axis sensitivity fix functionality. [b]This is the only mouse fix permitted for Vice City speedruns that are to be submitted to the speedrun.com leaderboards as of 2023/04/24.[/b]
I also removed any writing to memory addresses that did not actually seem to do anything. So for each game version, only two values will be written to two addresses; one for preventing sens reset, and one to fix y-axis sens.
All memory addresses taken from Lighnat0r's scripts (the mouse sens reset script and the y-axis fix ASI, which this is a fork of; the mouse sens reset fix didn't have its own repo).
